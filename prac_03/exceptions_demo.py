Answer the following questions:
1. When will a ValueError occur?
2. When will a ZeroDivisionError occur?
3. Could you change the code to avoid the possibility of a ZeroDivisionError?

# ValueError occurs when something other than an integer is entered
# ZeroDivisionError occurs when a zero is entered as the denominator
# Use an if statement to determine if the denominator is 0, if it is, ask for the denominator again
